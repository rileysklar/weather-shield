## Introduction

In today's climate-sensitive environment, protecting your assets from weather-related risks is more crucial than ever. Weather Shield offers a sophisticated solution that combines real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and actionable insights in one comprehensive platform.

## Core Features

### Interactive Map Interface

Our state-of-the-art mapping system provides:

```bash
# Example map initialization
weatherShield.initMap({
  center: [-98.5795, 39.8283],  # US center coordinates
  zoom: 4,
  style: 'weather-shield-default'
});
```

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Seamlessly pan and zoom across your project sites
- **Smart Visualization**:
  - Custom polygon site mapping
  - Risk-based color coding
  - Real-time weather overlays
  - Active alert indicators

### Project Site Management

Weather Shield supports various site types, each with specialized risk multipliers:

```bash
# Site type sensitivity multipliers
SITE_MULTIPLIERS = {
  solar_array: 1.2,    # Higher sensitivity to weather
  wind_farm: 1.3,      # Highest weather sensitivity
  hydroelectric: 1.1,  # Moderate sensitivity
  coal: 0.9,          # Lower sensitivity
  natural_gas: 0.9,   # Lower sensitivity
  nuclear: 0.8,       # Lowest sensitivity
  geothermal: 0.9,    # Lower sensitivity
  biomass: 0.9        # Lower sensitivity
}
```

### Weather Monitoring

Real-time data collection includes:

```bash
# Weather data structure
{
  temperature: {
    current: 72,
    feels_like: 70
  },
  wind: {
    speed: 15,        # mph
    direction: "NNE"
  },
  cloud_cover: 65,    # percentage
  visibility: 10,     # miles
  conditions: "Partly Cloudy"
}
```

### Risk Assessment

Our sophisticated risk calculation system:

```bash
# Risk thresholds
RISK_LEVELS = {
  extreme: 80,    # ≥80 risk score
  severe: 60,     # ≥60 risk score
  high: 40,       # ≥40 risk score
  moderate: 20,   # ≥20 risk score
  minor: 1        # >0 risk score
}
```

Key features include:
- Five-level risk categorization
- Site-specific risk factors
- Custom risk thresholds
- Visual risk indicators

### Alert Management

```bash
# Alert processing example
processAlert({
  severity: "extreme",
  type: "weather_warning",
  location: {
    coordinates: [-98.5795, 39.8283],
    radius: 50  # miles
  },
  duration: {
    start: "2024-01-25T10:00:00Z",
    end: "2024-01-26T10:00:00Z"
  }
});
```
